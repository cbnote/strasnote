* For JavaScript bundling and minification, we use BundlerMinifier (VS 2022 fork of Mads Kristensen's Web Compiler). You'll need to install [the extension](https://github.com/failwyn/BundlerMinifier). Right click [bundleconfig.json](src/Strasnote.Apps.Web/bundleconfig.json) > Bundler & Minifier > Update. You can also open Task Runner Explorer in VS (Ctrl+Alt+Backspace) to see the tasks.
